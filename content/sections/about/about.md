My professional experience and education are unique in that I have foundations in both software and hardware while also demonstrating strengths in technical communication. In previous roles I've developed scripts to assist DRAM product qualification, managed multi-million dollar enterprise OEM accounts on product developments in a fast-paced environment, and marketed for a portfolio of over 100 semiconductor products. From these experiences, I bring a high level of technical ability and business acumen to my roles.

I'm currently looking for a role in Hardware/Software Technical Sales in software or Software Engineering that focuses either on front-end or full-stack development with a company that I can grow with. HELLO
